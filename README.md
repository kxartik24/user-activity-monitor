#  UserActivityMonitor

**UserActivityMonitor** is a lightweight JavaScript-based application that tracks and logs user activity within a web page. It can be used for productivity tracking, session timeout alerts, or analytics on user behavior patterns.

##  Features

-  Tracks mouse movements, key presses, and clicks
-  Automatically logs activity timestamps
-  Displays activity logs in real-time on the page
-  Easy to customize for integration into web apps
-  Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no dependencies

##  Folder Structure

```
UserActivityMonitor/
│
├── index.html            # Main HTML file
├── style.css             # Basic styling for the page
└── script.js             # Core JavaScript for activity monitoring
```

##  How It Works

1. The script initializes and attaches event listeners to capture:
   - Mouse movement
   - Keyboard input
   - Mouse clicks

2. Each event is timestamped using `Date.toLocaleString()` and appended to the activity log on the webpage.

3. The console also logs each activity for debugging or further tracking.

##  Use Cases

- Track user interaction for idle timeout
- Monitor engagement on landing pages
- Audit and log admin panel activity
- Productivity tracking on internal tools

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
3. Interact with the page to see activity logs generated in real time.



##  To-Do / Future Enhancements

- Save logs to local storage or server
- Idle detection and timeout alerts
- Export logs as CSV
- User session summary
